Install Survival project. The password is "www.spgame.net".
Put sp2.exe and dinput.dll of B6oy's SPNET.net client in your SP installation and you can run Survival Project on Windows 10.

Simply launch sp2.exe. If you get an error, run it as administrator.

**Do not rename sp2.exe to anything else, or the game won't launch.**
